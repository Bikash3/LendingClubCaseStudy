## General Information
We at UPGRAD doing this Lending Club Case Study as a part of EDA. 

This company is the leading online loan marketplace, offering personal loans, business loans, and financing for medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access loans with lower interest rates through a quick online platform.

Similar to other lending institutions, the primary source of financial loss (known as credit loss) comes from lending to 'risky' applicants. Credit loss refers to the money lost by the lender when a borrower fails to repay or absconds with the owed funds. In essence, borrowers who default cause the greatest financial harm to lenders. In this context, customers labeled as 'charged-off' are considered the 'defaulters.'

The goal of this case study is to identify these high-risk loan applicants through exploratory data analysis (EDA), which can help reduce such loans and minimize credit loss.

Data set use is the Loan Dataset.
